# Rust Notes

`self` refers to the current instance of a type (like `this` in other languages).  

`Self` Refers to the current type of the `impl` block or trait.  

## üî• Summary of Differences

| **Feature**       | **`self` (lowercase)**                        | **`Self` (uppercase)**                      |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **What it refers to** | Current instance (like `this` in OOP)       | The current type of the `impl` block       |
| **Scope**           | Used in method signatures (`&self`, `self`)   | Used in type definitions (return, types)  |
| **Usage**           | Borrow, mutate, or consume the instance      | Return types, constructor, type aliasing  |
| **When used**       | Inside methods (requires an instance)       | Inside `impl` blocks (type context)       |
| **Example**         | `fn do_something(&self)`                     | `fn new() -> Self`                        |  

## üìù **Rust Concepts: `*self` and `ref`**

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ `*self`**  

#### **Definition**:

- **`*self`** dereferences a reference (like `&self`) to get access to the underlying value.  
- It allows pattern matching on the **actual value** rather than the reference.

#### **Usage**:

```rust
match *self {
    Cons(_, ref tail) => { 
        // *self gives access to the actual enum value
    },
    Nil => { 
        // Pattern match on the Nil variant 
    }
}
```

## üìù **Rust Concept: `ref`**

---

### **üîç Definition**

- **`ref`** creates a reference to a variable in pattern matching, allowing access to its value **without taking ownership**.  
- It enables borrowing of the matched value instead of moving it.

---

### **üí° Usage**

```rust
match self {
    Cons(_, ref tail) => {
        // `ref tail` creates a reference to `tail` instead of moving it
    },
    Nil => { 
        // Base case 
    }
}
```



## üìù **Difference Between `static` and `const` in Rust**

---

| **Feature**         | **`const`**                      | **`static`**                      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Memory Location** | No fixed memory location (inlined at each use) | Fixed memory location (same address for entire program) |
| **Lifetime**        | Exists only in the scope where it's used | Lives for the entire lifetime of the program |
| **Mutability**      | Always immutable                  | Can be mutable with `static mut` (unsafe) |
| **Initialization**  | Must be initialized with a **constant expression** | Can be initialized with runtime-computed values |
| **Usage**           | Compile-time constants (like `PI`, limits) | Global shared variables (like config, large data) |
| **Memory Overhead** | Each use has its own copy         | Single copy in memory, accessible from multiple places |
| **Access**          | Copied into each usage location   | Referenced via a fixed memory address |
| **Mutability Safety**| Safe (no unsafe required)        | Unsafe required for `static mut` access |
| **Data Size**       | Suitable for small, fixed-size data | Can hold large, complex data structures |
| **Common Use Cases**| Constants, magic numbers, simple expressions | Global configuration, shared state, large data |

---

### **üìò Summary**

- Use **`const`** for **small, compile-time constants** like numbers, limits, or magic values.  
- Use **`static`** for **global variables or large data** shared across the entire program.  
- **Avoid `static mut`** unless absolutely necessary, as it requires `unsafe` and can lead to data races.  

---

## `From` & `Into`

- From and Into traits are inherently linked  and this is actually part of its implementation
- If we can convert type A to type B then we can easily convert type B to type A

## Difference Between `..` and `..=` in Rust

| Operator | Name              | Description                        | Example        |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------------------|----------------|
| `..`     | Exclusive Range   | Creates a range excluding the end | `1..5` ‚Üí `1, 2, 3, 4` |
| `..=`    | Inclusive Range   | Creates a range including the end | `1..=5` ‚Üí `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` |

## **Rust Pattern Matching: Why `&` and `*` Can Be Omitted**

---

### **Key Insight: Rust's Match Ergonomics**

Rust automatically handles **borrowing** and **dereferencing** in `match` patterns, making the use of `&` and `*` optional in many cases. This is due to **automatic dereferencing** and **pattern matching ergonomics**.

---
### **Example 1: Matching a Reference Without `&`**  

```rust
let reference = &4;

match reference {
    val => println!("Got a value via destructuring: {:?}", val),
}
```

#### **Why It Works:**

- `reference` is of type `&i32` (a reference).
- The pattern `val` expects `i32`, **not `&i32`**.
- **Rust automatically dereferences** `reference` behind the scenes:

  ```rust
  let val = *reference;  // Auto-dereferencing happens
  ```

- This removes the need to explicitly match `&val`.

---

### **Example 2: Dereferencing Without `*`**

```rust
let reference = &4;

match reference {
    val => println!("Got a value via dereferencing: {:?}", val),
}
```

#### **Why It Works:**

- The value of `reference` is `&i32`.
- Rust sees that `reference` is a reference but expects `i32`.
- Rust automatically **dereferences** `reference` behind the scenes:

  ```rust
  match *reference {  // Auto-dereferencing happens
      val => println!("Got a value via dereferencing: {:?}", val),
  }
  ```

---

### **How Rust's Matching Works**

Rust applies these rules when matching references:

- **If the matched value is a reference (`&T`), and the pattern expects `T`, Rust automatically dereferences.**
- **If the matched value is not a reference but the pattern expects one, Rust automatically borrows.**

---

### **When to Use `&val` or `*reference` Explicitly**

- Use `&val` if you want to **manually destructure** a reference in a pattern.
- Use `*reference` if you want to **manually dereference** a reference in an expression.
- Use these only when **you want explicit control** over how references are handled.

---

### **Summary**

Rust's match ergonomics simplify how you work with references by:

- Automatically borrowing or dereferencing when needed.
- Allowing you to omit `&` or `*` in most match statements.
- Making your code more readable and concise.

## **Rust Match Guards**

- A match guard in Rust is an additional conditional check that you can apply to a match arm using the if keyword. It acts as a filter to decide whether a particular arm should be selected when the pattern matches.

## üîç **Difference between `if-let` and `let-else` in Rust

| **Criteria**           | **`if-let`**                            | **`let-else`**                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Pattern matching with optional control flow | Pattern matching with early exit  |
| **Syntax**             | `if let Pattern = value { ... } else { ... }` | `let Pattern = value else { ... };` |
| **Usage**              | Used when you want to handle both success and failure cases | Used when you want to exit early on failure |
| **Control Flow**       | Continues with program flow after handling the pattern | Exits early using `return`, `break`, or `panic!` |
| **Requires an `else`?**| No, but you can add it optionally         | **Yes, `else` is mandatory**            |
| **Early Return?**      | ‚ùå No, unless explicitly written          | ‚úÖ Yes, it requires early return logic  |
| **Readability**        | Cleaner for inline flow control         | Cleaner for early-exit control flow     |
| **When to Use?**       | When you want to handle both branches    | When you want to exit early on failure  |

---

### üß† **When to Use Which?**

| **Use Case**           | **Which to Use?**             | **Reason**                              |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Handle both cases (`Some` / `None`) | **`if-let`**     | Cleaner when handling both possibilities |
| Early return or exit on `None`      | **`let-else`**   | Clean, avoids unnecessary indentation   |
| No need for `else` clause           | **`if-let`**     | `else` is optional for `if-let`         |
| Explicit early return, break, or panic | **`let-else`** | Built for early exits like `return`    |

## **Rust Modules**

- Rust provided a powerful module system that can be used to hierarchically split code in logical units
(modules), and manage visibility (public/private) between them.

- A module is a collection of items: functions, structs, trait, impl blocks and ever other modules

## **Rust Crates**

- A crate is Rust's compilation unit, either a binary or library. Modules are inlined before compilation. Only crates are compiled; use `--crate-type` to specify a library.  

    ```rust
    rustc --crate-type=lib rary.rs
    rustc executable.rs --extern rary=library.rlib && executable
    ```

## **Rust Cargo**

`cargo` is the official Rust Package management tool. Features of `cargo` includes :-

- Dependency Management and integration with crates.io.
- Awareness of unit tests.
- Awareness of benchmarks.

## **Rust Conditional Configuration Checks**

Configuration conditional checks are possible through two different operators:

1. **The `cfg` attribute:** `#[cfg(...)]` in attribute position
2. **The `cfg!` macro:** `cfg!(...)` in boolean expressions

While the former enables conditional compilation, the latter conditionally evaluates to `true` or `false` literals allowing for checks at run-time. Both utilize identical argument syntax.

`cfg!`, unlike `#[cfg]`, does not remove any code and only evaluates to `true` or `false`. For example, all blocks in an `if/else` expression need to be valid when `cfg!` is used for the condition, regardless of what `cfg!` is evaluating.

## **Phantom Types in Rust**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ What are Phantom Types?**

Phantom types are a technique used in Rust to represent and track types at the **type level** without actually storing any values of that type at runtime. This is achieved using the `PhantomData<T>` marker from Rust‚Äôs standard library.

- **Compile-Time Only**: Phantom types exist only at compile time, and they have no runtime overhead.
- **Zero-Sized**: Since PhantomData doesn‚Äôt store any actual data, it has zero runtime size and cost.
- **Type Marker**: It allows us to track type information even when the type isn‚Äôt directly used in the struct or enum.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Purpose of Phantom Types**

Phantom types are commonly used to **track type states** and **enforce compile-time guarantees**. 

#### **Use Cases**

- **Type-State Pattern**: Restrict the usage of certain functions based on the type state.
- **Compile-Time Safety**: Prevent misuse of APIs by restricting operations to specific states.
- **Type-Level Programming**: Act as an indicator for types, such as marking a file as "Open" or "Closed".
- **Lifetimes**: Track lifetimes in generic structs or wrappers.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ What is PhantomData?**

`PhantomData<T>` is a **marker type** that tells the Rust compiler that a struct or enum "logically" owns a value of type `T`, even though it doesn‚Äôt actually store it.

#### **Why Use PhantomData?**

1. **Type Visibility**: To make Rust‚Äôs type system aware that a struct is associated with a specific type `T`, even if it‚Äôs not used in the struct‚Äôs fields.
2. **Zero-Cost Abstraction**: PhantomData has zero size and no impact on memory layout or runtime performance.
3. **Ownership and Drop Semantics**: It can indicate ownership of a type to affect Rust‚Äôs drop-checking behavior.

#### **Declaration Example**

```rust
use std::marker::PhantomData;

struct MyStruct<T> {
    _marker: PhantomData<T>,
}
```

Here, `PhantomData<T>` makes Rust‚Äôs type system aware that `MyStruct` is logically associated with type `T`, even if `T` is not actually used in the struct.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Concepts of Phantom Types**

#### **1. Type-State Pattern**

- **Definition**: A pattern where the type of a struct changes to represent its "state."
- **How**: PhantomData allows you to track the state at the type level, enabling you to have types like `File<Open>` and `File<Closed>`. 
- **Goal**: Prevent operations on a type in an invalid state (e.g., calling `read()` on a `File<Closed>`).

#### **2. Compile-Time Guarantees**

- **Safety**: PhantomData allows functions to be called only when the struct is in a specific state.
- **Type-Checked at Compile Time**: Rust‚Äôs type system will ensure you‚Äôre using the type in the right state, leading to fewer runtime errors.

#### **3. Zero-Cost Abstraction**

- **Memory Layout**: PhantomData does not store anything at runtime.
- **Performance**: No runtime cost, no runtime memory usage, no effect on struct‚Äôs size.

#### **4. Ownership and Drop Semantics**

- If you want Rust‚Äôs ownership system to recognize that a struct "logically" owns a type `T`, even if it‚Äôs not physically stored, you use `PhantomData<T>`. This impacts Rust‚Äôs drop-checking logic.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ PhantomData vs Regular Data Fields**

| **Concept**         | **PhantomData<T>**          | **Normal Field T**     |
|------------------- |---------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Memory Usage**     | 0 bytes                    | Depends on size of `T` |
| **Compile-Time Info**| Exists at compile-time     | Exists at runtime     |
| **Drop Semantics**    | May affect ownership logic | Normal drop logic      |
| **Type Tracking**     | Tracks type `T` only       | Tracks type and stores data |
| **Cost**             | Zero-cost abstraction     | Actual memory cost    |

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ When to Use Phantom Types?**

Phantom types are useful when you want to:

1. **Track Type-State Transitions**: Ensure certain methods are only called in specific states.
2. **Zero-Sized Type-Tracking**: Associate logical ownership of a type to affect drop-checking.
3. **Signal Intent**: Provide compile-time indicators of type-level information.
4. **Lifetimes Tracking**: Use PhantomData to associate lifetimes with a struct (like in smart pointers).

---

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Benefits of Using Phantom Types**

| **Benefit**         | **Description**                              |
|------------------- |--------------------------------------------|
| **Compile-time safety** | Restrict invalid usage of types and methods |
| **Zero-cost abstraction** | No runtime overhead, zero memory impact  |
| **Logical Ownership**    | Track logical ownership of types          |
| **Cleaner API Design**   | Make APIs more robust and state-aware     |

---

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Drawbacks of Phantom Types**

| **Drawback**        | **Description**                              |
|------------------- |--------------------------------------------|
| **Complexity**       | May increase cognitive load for new developers |
| **Type Bloat**       | Type annotations may get verbose             |
| **Learning Curve**   | May require deeper understanding of Rust‚Äôs type system |

---

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Phantom Types vs Lifetimes**

| **Concept**         | **Phantom Types**          | **Lifetimes**           |
|------------------- |---------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Track type information     | Track memory lifetimes   |
| **Scope**           | Compile-time type tracking| Compile-time memory tracking|
| **Used With**       | Custom state tracking     | Borrowing references     |

While PhantomData can track lifetimes too, it‚Äôs often used for **type information**, while lifetimes are used for **memory tracking**.

---

### **üåê Glossary**

- **Phantom Type**: A type that exists only at compile-time and does not occupy memory at runtime.
- **PhantomData**: A Rust marker type used to associate phantom types with a struct.
- **Zero-Sized Type (ZST)**: A type that has no memory representation and takes up 0 bytes.
- **Type-State Pattern**: A design pattern where the type of a struct reflects its "state" at compile time.
- **Drop Semantics**: Rules that govern when and how Rust‚Äôs ownership system "drops" values to free memory.

---

### **üîπ Summary**

1. **Phantom Types** help track **logical type ownership** and **state changes**.
2. **PhantomData<T>** associates a type `T` with a struct or enum at compile time without storing it at runtime.
3. Used to **enforce compile-time guarantees** and **track type-state transitions**.
4. **Zero-cost abstraction** with **no runtime overhead**.
5. Helps in **type-state pattern**, **lifetime tracking**, and **ownership tracking**.
